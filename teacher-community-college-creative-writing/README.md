# teacher-community-college-creative-writing

## Scope

This model is designed for a student to get help with creative writing and ideas around creative writing. The model wants to help
the student find success through conversations and ideation. It is the "pair programmer" of writing things for a creative writing
class.

## Example
```
>>> I'd like to write a haiku about fish, where can i start?
That's a wonderful choice! A haiku is a form of traditional Japanese poetry that focuses on nature and typically includes a
seasonal reference, or "kigo". It consists of three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable count.

To begin, let's consider the fish as your subject. Here are some guiding questions to get you started:

1. What are some distinctive features of fish that could be highlighted in your haiku? (Consider their physical attributes,
behavior, or habitat.)
2. How do you want to portray the fish in your poem? Are they graceful, elusive, majestic, or perhaps something else?
3. Does a specific season resonate with you when thinking about this particular fish species or its environment?

Remember, haiku isn't just about describing; it's also about capturing a moment in time, a fleeting emotion or observation. Let
your own unique perspective on the subject guide your writing.

Once you have some ideas about these aspects, we can work on crafting your haiku together. You might start with something like:

5 syllables... (describe the fish or its environment)
7 syllables... (convey the feeling or action related to the fish)
5 syllables... (include a seasonal reference or conclude with impact)

I'm excited to see where your creativity takes this!

>>> what are fish names that are less than 4 syllables?
Excellent question! Many fish have names that fit well within the syllable count of a haiku. Here's a list of common fish, each
with fewer than four syllables:

1. Clownfish
2. Angelfish
3. Betta (or Siamese Fighting Fish)
4. Goldfish
5. Koi
6. Salmon
7. Trout
8. Shark
9. Piranha
10. Catfish
11. Eel
12. Sturgeon
13. Tuna
14. Swordfish
15. Jellyfish
16. Ray
17. Seahorse
18. Squids (though they're not fish, they're often associated with marine life)

Remember, the name of the fish can serve as a starting point for your haiku. It could be used to describe its appearance,
behavior, or the experience of encountering it in its natural habitat. For instance, you might focus on the vibrant colors of a
clownfish, the elegance of a dancing shark, or the serene grace of a goldfish swimming in a pond.

Take your time to consider which fish resonates with you the most, and let's continue developing your haiku!
